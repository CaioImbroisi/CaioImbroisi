#### Hello everyone! I'm Caio, Brazilian and I'm starting to code.

I love games, and with this love of games I started streaming, and in one of these streams there was a chat about programming, I got interested and signed up for a challenge to learn the basics of programming in a week.
I loved the challenge and decided to make programming my profession.

I'm currently studying web development at the Trybe course.
